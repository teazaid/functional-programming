  /*
  * Every applicative is a functor and by the laws for Applicatives,
  * this property has to hold valid: fmap = apply Î¿ pure. This law ensures that we can use applicative as a functor i.e on arity -1 function.

  Applicatives allows us to apply functions of arbitrary arity (>=1) to its arguments
  inside a computational context, and as functors provide for the exact functions of arity-1,
  Applicatives can be thought as generalized functors.
